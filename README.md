## Milestone 1 Feedback
You'll need to correct your directory structure - take a look at the [Milestone 1 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/). Be sure that your directory structure and file naming matches **exactly**. `milestone-1.html` should be a `php` file, and be sure that all your latest changes are committed and pushed, because what you have deployed does not exactly line up with GitHub.

Your documentation here is excellent, but your plans for the project are way out of scope for PWP. Remember that PWP will only be a one-page static site for now, and what you propose to build here is HUGE. For now, let's narrow your scope to fit a one-page site. This means that the design gallery and multiple page themes will have to go - this is just not feasible with the limited class time and capstone project. In addition, the kind of functionality that you describe here will require the use of additional libraries and frameworks, and that falls out of scope as well.

Your ideas for SycamoreHoller.com are awesome - but just too ambitious to achieve in 8 weeks. The first site I thought of when reading your documentation was the [Codrops Blog](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) and their live demos. I think it's worth noting that top-tier sites that feature live demos of themes/plugins/etc (codrops, themeforest, etc.) will generally do so in a separate page or tab with links or a panel across the top that clearly informs the user where they are, and that they are only inside a *demo view* not the main site itself. And how to navigate back to the main site content. I think that if you radically switch the layout/design of a site from page to page, you run the risk of it being a visually confusing "WTF moment" for the user. I think there needs to be a common visual context for a good UX. Even the best demo sites can get a little crazy to navigate - and don't forget, your main goal here is to drive SALES of your web development services. So don't let your design ambitions get in the way of that. Your site design should never confuse the user or present obstacles before the main goal.

You mention a blog in your use case. This is also out-of-scope for PWP because blog functionality requires you build a back-end, or install 3rd party software like WordPress. Definitely something to install down the line.

Simple animation for your PWP can be done using CSS and jQuery - these touches are definitely within scope. Also, setting an autoresponder on your contact form should also be easy to do using the Swiftmailer library. These features are a go.

So, TL; DR: narrow down your scope a bit to fit a one-page static site. The sky's the limit come week 11. And please fix your directory structure prior to completing Milestone 2 &alpha;. Your HTML is looking great.

Overall, nice work on the documentation here. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin Milestone 2&alpha;.
