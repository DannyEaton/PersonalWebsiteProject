			<h1>Section 1: Goal, Audience, and Purpose for Sycamoreholler.com</h1>
			<dl>
				<dt>Goal and Purpose</dt>
					<dd>The goal of Sycamoreholler.com is to attract its audience with great visual design techniques to attract clientele that are interested in finding a web developer to make a website/webapplication for any purpose, but specifically for small businesses.
					</dd>
				<dt>Audience</dt>
					<dd>The preferred audience of Sycamoreholler.com is an established small business owner who is looking to market their business and make more money. They are a stickler for a good design but not quite sure on exactly how they want their website to look. They have seen some websites that they do admire, yet they cannot explain why they like said website's features and design.</dd>
				<dt>Purpose</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The first purpose of Sycamore Holler is directly related to its goal: attracting clientele who would like to purchase or are thinking about purchasing a website. The second purpose of Sycamore Holler is to show different designs and features to a user to see what they would like.
						<p>Every page of this website will feature a different style that a user or possible clientele might want their website to emulate. There will be pages dedicated to many different designs relating to various assortments of features on a website. For example, one page might be dedicated to displaying different menus for a user to consider, all with different color schemes with different styles of menus (hamburger, full screen navigation, bottom screen navigation, vertical stacks, slide out menus, drop down menus, or maybe even no menu at all). The theme of displaying different styles of menus will be applied to every part of a website, including but not limited to: functionality, mobile design, layouts, animations, color schemes, fonts, landing pages, forms, databases and even web applications.</p>

						<p>The next way Sycamore Holler will achieve its purpose is to show the user/possible clientele <i>why they should purchase a website for their business</i>. There will a page describing how a website will improve their image and online presence while specifically explaining how a website will make them money. It will display statistics to the user or clientele just how a website attracts more customers and why purchasing a website from Sycamore Holler will help their business.</p></dd>

			<h1>Section 3: User Case</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Jonathan is at a the office by himself after grabbing lunch to go at his favorite restaurant, close to his office. He is browsing the internet on his 2560x1600 227ppi Macbook Pro screen, he finds a blog post about website branding and data that shows how profitable having a decent website is. He clicks on the link.</li>
				<li>Jon lands on a blog post/landing page at SycamoreHoller.com</li>
				<li>The content is well written and very interesting, he reads the whole article which isnt too long but explains enough to bring a convincing point on why a company website should be important to a business owner</li>
				<li>He notices just how neat this website looks and decides to click on the home button on the navigation bar at the bottom of the landing page/blog post. It has given him something interesting to read and he is now starting to remember that idea he had of purchasing a website for his company.</li>
				<li>He notices this website is for a web development company based in Albuquerque. His interest is piqued but he is also aware that he is now a target of a sale, which slightly has him alerted and skeptical</li>
				<li>Even though he is skeptical, he enjoys the way the website looks: very professional and conservatively designed yet seems incredibly "modern" and "trendy".</li>
				<li>He thinks a design like this would be perfect for his law firm./li>
				<li>After a quick scroll through on the homepage about Sycamore Holler and its selling points he scrolls up to the home page, he is about to leave the site and go back to LawyersWeekly.com</li>
				<li>He notices a part of the navigation bar that says "Designs". His interest has been piqued once more however he is still very aware he is a target of a sale.</li>
				<li>He clicks, and sees a very cultivated and savvy yet extremely short 2 second animation that has the screen go from a smooth transition from the home page to the design page, almost as if the page didnt load at all.</li>
				<li>He sees an assortment of parts of a website that can be customized and likes the fact that one can control so many aspects of a website. He is now very interested but still aware he is being sold to, he is slowly starting to give into his urge to purchase a website.</li>
				<li>He clicks on the menu section, he sees another brief but aesthetic animation that brings him to this page yet he doesnt even notice he has changed the page of the website. He sees the various options he can choose from and styles that are trending right now, even though most of them are very "artsy", liberal and bright in their design, he is impressed the maker of the website is able to perform such actions.</li>
				<li>He has seen enough and has to get back to reading over a few contracts for his clients. As he is at the bottom of the page, he sees a call to action button saying "schedule a consultation"</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>RAINY DAY SCENARIO</strong> Jonathan realizes he is now being directly marketed to and snaps out of the trance he was put in and realizes that purchasing a website is expensive. The thought of buying a website has definitely been moved from "the backburner" in is mind now but he may take a week, two weeks, or even a month to see if he still wants to go through with this. He exits his browser and gets to work. However in the coming days the thought will pop into his mind, a seed has been planted and he will think of Sycamore Holler when he thinks about developing a custom website.</li>
				<li><strong>SUNNY DAY SCENARIO</strong> Jonathan fills out the form, each part of the form brightens aesthetically yet subtly as he clicks on it, he is still delighted as he schedules his consultation. Its not a second after he clicks "submit" that he notices his Samsung Galaxy S8 Edge light up with an email notification, saying that his email has been received and his consultation has been scheduled for the time and day he requested. Four minutes later a developer and consultant emails him with a personal and friendly introductory message about the consultation. He is excited and tells his business partner James. His partner Mr.Rustles is slightly annoyed that he made the consultation, however he knows a consultation is just a consultation after all, and no guarantee of sale has been made. They will decide on whether or not to go through with the purchase after they talk about designing the website, the price, marketing, and other specifics with the consultant/developer. </li>
